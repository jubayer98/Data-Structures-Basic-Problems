# Data Structures Basic Problems in C++

This repository contains solutions to various basic data structure problems implemented in C++. These solutions are designed to help understand the fundamental concepts and operations related to different data structures. 

### Prerequisites
To compile and run the programs, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. For example, you can use `g++`, which is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

### Running the Programs
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jubayer98/Data-Structures-Basic-Problems.git
   cd Data-Structures-Basic-Problems
   ```

2. Compile the desired program:
   ```bash
   g++ -o output_file source_file.cpp
   ```

3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./output_file
   ```
